        <h1>Hello, I'm Preeti!</h1>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m originally from Kolkata, India, and I hold a BTech degree in Electronics & Communication. I previously worked as a Software Engineer at Tech Mahindra. Besides listening to music, shopping, and traveling, my main hobby is makeup and hairstyling. What started as a hobby has now become my passion. I am now a certified cosmetologist and professional makeup artist and hairstylist based in Frisco, TX. With more than a decade of experience in the beauty industry, I specialize in crafting exquisite looks tailored for weddings, cultural celebrations, and other special events.
